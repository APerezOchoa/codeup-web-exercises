    <h3 id="carlsbad-heading">Carlsbad Caverns National Park</h3>
    <ul id="carlsbad-facts">
        <li>Carlsbad Cavern is one of over 300 limestone caves in a fossil reef laid down by an inland sea about 265 million years ago. <br>
            Twelve-to-fourteen thousand years ago, American Indians lived in the Guadalupe Mountains. Some of their cooking ring sites<br>
            and pictographs have been found within the present day boundaries of the park.</li>
        <li>The park's cultural resources represent a long and varied continuum of human use starting in prehistoric times and illustrating<br>
            many adaptations to the Chihuahuan Desert environment. Human activities, including prehistoric and historic American Indian<br>
            occupations, European exploration and settlement, industrial exploitation, commercial and cavern accessibility development and<br>
            tourism have left reminders of their presence, and have contributed to the rich and diverse history of the area.</li>
        <li>Location and terrain: Southeastern New Mexico; Guadalupe Mountains (primarily limestone) and Permian Basin (primarily gypsum). <br>
            Size: 46,766 acres (18,925 hectares), including over 33,000 acres (13,354 hectares) designated wilderness.</li>
        <li class="" id="last">Surface ecosystems: Chihuahuan Desert, with Pinyon-Juniper in higher elevations and shrub/grass lands in lower. Which is home to<br>
            750 plants species, 67 species of mammals, 17 bat species, 357 bird species and 54 amphibian and reptile species.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="white-heading">White Sands National Park</h3>
    <ul id="white-facts">
        <li>On July 16, 1945, one week after the establishment of White Sands Missile Range (WSMR), the world’s first atomic bomb was <br>
            detonated in the north-central portion of the missile range, approximately 60 miles north of White Sands National Monument.</li>
        <li>At 5:30 a.m. on July 16, the nuclear device, known as “Gadget,” was successfully detonated. A multi-colored cloud surged <br>
            38,000 feet into the air within seven minutes. Where the tower had been was a crater one-half mile across and eight feet deep.<br>
            Sand in the crater was fused by the intense heat into a glass-like solid, the color of green jade.</li>
        <li>Although no information on the test was released until after the atomic bomb had been used as a weapon, the flash of light and <br>
            shock wave made a vivid impression over an area with a radius of at least 160 miles.</li>
        <li class="" id="last2">Also located by the park, White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) has had a historic past and an impressive mission for today’s security. The <br>
            U.S. military established a permanent presence in the Tularosa Basin during World War II, creating White Sands Proving Grounds, now <br>
            called White Sands Missile Range, as well as the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, known today as Holloman Air Force Base.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="guadalupe-heading">Guadalupe Mountains National Park</h3>
    <ul id="guadalupe-facts">
        <li>Guadalupe Mountains National Park preserves one of the finest examples of an ancient, marine fossil reef on Earth. During the Permian period, <br>
            about 265 million years ago, a vast tropical sea covered much of the region. Within this sea, calcareous sponges, algae, and other lime-secreting <br>
            marine organisms, along with lime precipitated from the seawater, built up and formed a reef that paralleled the shoreline for 400 miles.   </li>
        <li>After this sea evaporated, the reef was buried in thick blankets of sediment and mineral salts, and was entombed for millions of years until uplift<br>
            exposed massive portions of it. Today, geologists and scientists come from around the world to study this phenomenal example of a fossilized reef.</li>
        <li>The biological diversity within Guadalupe Mountains National Park is outstanding and includes more than 1000 species of plants. While many of <br>
            these are common desert species such as ocotillo and prickly pear cactus, others are found only in the park and nowhere else in the world.</li>
        <li class="" id="last3">Guadalupe Mountains rise sharply from the surrounding desert floor to form an island of outstanding diversity. Several different ecosystems, or <br>
            life zones, are found within the park. These include the harsh Chihuahuan desert community, lush streamside woodlands of oaks and maples, rocky<br>
            canyons, and mountaintop forests of ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. Together, these ecosystems provide habitat for 60 species of mammals, 289 <br>
            species of birds, and 55 species of reptiles.</li>
    </ul>
